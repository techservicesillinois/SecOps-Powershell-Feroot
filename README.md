# What is This?

This Powershell module acts as a wrapper for the Feroot REST API, allowing you to create scripts that run operations tasks in Feroot.
This module is not a feature-complete match of the Feroot API. Please consider contributing functions to this module or requesting functionality that may be valuable.

# How do I install it?

The latest stable release is always available via the [PSGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/UofIFeroot).
```powershell
# This will install on the local machine
Install-Module -Name 'UofIFeroot'
```

# How does it work?

Get-Help is available for all functions in this module.
You must run New-FerootSession before other functions can be used.
